Simply Pinterest - a WordPress Plugin is a WordPress plugin designed to be light weight, easy to use while achieving one goal: making it easy for your visitors to share your content on Pinterest.

== Description ==

More and more bloggers are seeing success in traffic from Pinterest. We've even heard that for some bloggers Pinterest is beating out Google as their top referer. Make it easy and obvious your visitors should share your content.

This plugin creates a prominent call to action over your each image in your post to prompt visitors to Pin your content. The window to save your content to their board is in a pop-up so they never leave your site.
The button uses the default Pinterest button that users identify with sharing their favorite content across the web. It also includes the number of times that post has been shared which can help a popular post go viral by making it obvious to your users that other people love it too!

=== Battling Bad Source URLs ===

Even when the Pinterest button is triggered from your home page, search or archives the Pin is credited to the permalink page of your content automatically. This way the traffic comes to the page they were looking for straight from Pinterest.

=== Customize Settings ====

This plugin does the following:

* Choose whether to show the Pin it button when a user hovers over your images or always. You can even customize this on specific images too!
* Lets you to customize the Pin it button color between Pinterest red, white & gray
* Allows you to choose the button size (small or large) & position of the count bubble
* Respects the same `no-pin="nopin"` attribute for your image tags, the same convention Pinterest uses, making it easy to prevent images you don't want Pinned from being Pinned
* Customize what page types the button displays on, choose home page, posts, pages, archives and search
* Further control letting you prevent a specific page or post from having the pin it button over the images
* Detailed control letting you prevent individual images from having the Pin it button over it
* Uses the permalink to credit your content even from the home page, archives and search!

If you're looking for an easy way to pin images in your blog posts and pages, this plugin will help you with that. It highlights images and adds a "Pin it" button over them once the user hovers his mouse over an image. Once the user clicks the "Pin it" button, the plugin shows a pop-up window with the image and a description. Everything is ready for pinning, although the user can alter the description.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `better-pinterest-plugin/` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your installation of WordPress
3. Configure the settings in the menu under Settings > Pinterest Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Customize the Button With a Different Graphic? =

No, to keep the plugin light and easy to use we only support the default Pinterest branded buttons. Pinterest has put their design resources into what works well to get users to click that "Pin It" button and it really stands out to the user that they should pin the great images you have in your post to come back to your content and share it with their followers.

If you want a more subtle appraoch try setting the button to only show on hover and have it permenantly display on the most Pinnable buttons!

= How can I change the Pinterst Description =

When you upload an image through WordPress you are prompted to add a "description" in the media upload window. That is that text this plugin uses to pre-fill the pin's description

== Screenshots ==

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
