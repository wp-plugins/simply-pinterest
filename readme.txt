Automatically add a Pin It button on every image. No shortcodes necessary, this flexible plugin makes it easy for your visitors to share your content.

== Description ==

With Simply Pinterest make it easy and obvious your visitors should share your content without adding additional work to your blogging workflow.

This plugin adds a Pin It button call to action over your each image in your post to prompt visitors to Pin your content. The window to save your content to their board is in a pop-up so they never leave your site.
The button uses the default Pinterest button that users identify with sharing their favorite content across the web. You can customize how the plugin is applied to your site with counts, colors & many other settings.

You can see more, including a video trailor of the plugin at [SimplyPinterest.com](http://simplypinterest.com/)

= Battling Bad Source URLs =

Even when the Pinterest button is triggered from your home page, search or archives the Pin is credited to the *permalink page* of your content automatically. This way the traffic comes to the page they were looking for straight from Pinterest.

= Customize Settings =

This plugin does the following:

* Choose whether to show the Pin it button when a user hovers over your images or always. You can even override your default settings for specific images!
* Lets you to customize the Pin it button color between Pinterest red, white & gray
* Allows you to choose the button size (small or large) & position of the count bubble
* Respects the same `no-pin="nopin"` attribute for your image tags, the same convention Pinterest uses, making it easy to prevent images you don't want Pinned from being Pinned
* Customize what page types the button displays on, choose home page, posts, pages, archives and search
* Further control letting you prevent a specific page or post from having the pin it button over the images
* Detailed control letting you prevent individual images from having the Pin it button over it
* Uses the permalink to credit your content even from the home page, archives and search!

If you're looking for an easy way to pin images in your blog posts and pages, this plugin will help you with that. It highlights images and adds a "Pin it" button over them once the user hovers his mouse over an image. Once the user clicks the "Pin it" button, the plugin shows a pop-up window with the image and a description. Everything is ready for pinning, although the user can alter the description.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I Customize the Button With a Different Graphic? =

No, to keep the plugin light and easy to use we only support the default Pinterest branded buttons. Pinterest has put their design resources into what works well to get users to click that "Pin It" button and it really stands out to the user that they should pin the great images you have in your post to come back to your content and share it with their followers.

If you want a more subtle appraoch try setting the button to only show on hover and have it permenantly display on the most Pinnable buttons!

= How can I change the Pinterst Description =

When you upload an image through WordPress you are prompted to add a "description" in the media upload window. That is that text this plugin uses to pre-fill the pin's description

4. The Pin wil use the description in your image's "Title" or "Alt" fields as set through your WordPress admin.
5. Advanced settings allow you to prevent an image from being pinned and changing the display of the button to force it to show or force it to only show on mouseover (which will override your default setting for that image only)
6. The Pin it button makes sure your post's permalink is pinned no matter what page it's pinned from and pre-populates the pin with the image that was selected and the "Title" or "Alt" text as set in the WordPress Admin.
